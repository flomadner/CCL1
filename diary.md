14.1: made some background pixel-art and started to code only to throw the whole code away.

15.1: restarted the coding, did the player object and used the skeleton spritesheet, coded randomized items

16.1: Made items spawn consecutively, added values for score and lives in main, implemented so that when items hit the ground the player loses a life, made the game over screen

17.1: finished my collision detection. The player now looses a life if good items drop on the floor but doesnt when bad items fall on the floor. Also the scoring works correctly now (yippie)
