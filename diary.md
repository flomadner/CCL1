14.1: made some background pixel-art and started to code only to throw the whole code away.

15.1: restarted the coding, did the player object and used the skeleton spritesheet, coded randomized items

16.1: Made items spawn consecutively, added values for score and lives in main, implemented so that when items hit the ground the player loses a life, made the game over screen

17.1: finished my collision detection. The player now looses a life if good items drop on the floor but doesnt when bad items fall on the floor. Also the scoring works correctly now (yippie), tried to fix the bounds of the item drop, bug with bounds of player when he touches the left or right side of the canvas 

18.1: implemented a "play again" button for my game over screen and redid some of the item art to make them a bigger size. Also made it so the scoring and the health display are on the top left corner of the canvas, implemented the start screen with a "start game" button. Added new items like a heart that adds health and made the player lose a life if they catch a bomb. implemented the background art for the starting screen.

20.1: made the fee walking sprites and implemented them in the game, replacing the skeleton template ones. Also implemented my main screen.

21.1: implemented the animations in the gameover screen and the start screen.

22.1: implemented the starting screen animation. (thank you lukas)
