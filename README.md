## ‚úçÔ∏è **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Item mechanics:** Implementing different items with different characteristics made a lot of fun.
- **Sprites:** The implementation of the sprites went surprisingly smooth.

### Challenges:
- **Having a plan:** Figuring out what to prioritize/whats the most important to implement first.
- **Not being overwhelmed:** In the beginning I struggled with that since it seemed like everyone else had a plan and more skills, but as the week went on I became more confident and I also learned a lot.
- **Animations on Start/Gameover screens:** It took a long time to figure out how to have Fee animated on those screens.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Don¬¥t be afraid to ask for help:** No one expects you to suddenly be a programming master and others won¬¥t judge you for it.
- **Keep it Simple:** Start with the basic mechanics. Once you have those down you can always add more features.
